# C# Roguelike
This a basic rougelike I made in Monodevelop just to mess around and I didn't want to use any external libraries.
The code is pretty awful and basically everything needs to be changed but it is in a vaguely playable state.
I've only tested this on Linux but in theory it should run on Windows and Mac maybe with some small changes.
